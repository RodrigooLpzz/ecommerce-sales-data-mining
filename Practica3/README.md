Homework #3 - Week 6

I worked on data visualization, I checked the data types again to remember which columns are numeric and which are categorical

I created histograms for columns like price, discounted price, total revenue, rating and review count. I only noticed spread in revenue and discount price

Then I created bar charts for quantity sold, discount percent, product category, payment method and customer region. It didn't help a lot, this columns have the same number of elements in their categories

I created a scatter plot between rating and total revenue. In the last homework the correlation was almost zero, and here visually it also looks the same, no relationship

Finally, I grouped revenue by month to see if there are periods where amazon sells more. It changes over time but there is no clear constant growth
